Lot's of people ask for advice on how to get started in open source.

I have been in the same situation myself.

What works for me is, instead of directly jumping into the code, become a
user first! We will soon enough

This mindset is not only helpful in open source, but software engineering
in general. You need to understand your users to be able to build a good
product, and on of the easiest ways of doing so is to be a user yourself, i.e.,
eat your own dog food.
