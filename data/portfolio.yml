          3h Workshop: Advanced CI Security Powered by the Open Source Community
        description: |
          In this workshop, we will learn how to secure your CI/CD pipeline
          using open source tools and best practices. We will cover how to: \
          • Understand how attackers think (Threat Modelling) \
          • Sign and verify git commits \
          • Scan for vulnerabilities in containers and binaries \
          • Generate SBOMs to make security decisions \
          • Sign your build artifacts \
          • Demonstrate how clients verify artifacts

          Hacking & Defending Kubernetes Clusters: We'll Do It LIVE!!
        description: |
          Ever wondered about the security of your own Kubernetes cluster,
          but new to Kubernetes security and not sure where to start? In this
          talk Fabian and James will, via a series of live demos, demonstrate
          both common attacks and offensive techniques against Kubernetes
          clusters and workloads, and the runtime controls to protect against
          them. Scenarios include: Leveraging a compromised Container to
          attack the underlying node, pivot across the network, or abuse
          accessible secrets and tokens.  A Malicious Insider exploiting common
          RBAC misconfigurations. Using a single node to hijack the entire cluster.

          Each attack will be contextualised via mapping to the threat model
          resources available to the community today, such as the MITRE ATT&CK®
          Containers Matrix and CNCF Financial Services User Group attack trees.
          Fabian and James will explain how to use these resources, and the
          demonstrated attacks and controls to threat model, security test and
          defend your own Kubernetes Clusters.

          Level-up your security game as a K8s developer!
        description: |
          In this talk I will present how to incorporate security best practices
          in your day-to-day tasks as a (Golang) Kubernetes developer. We will
          cover how to sign your git commits, scan container images for vulnerabilities
          and release + deploy minimal images that make both you and your SREs happy!
          We will heavily rely on the Sigstore ecosystem to sign without the hassle of
          key management. No subscriptions or server deployments are required, which
          will enable you to adopt these practices right away.

          Verifiable Build Environments in the Cloud: Powered by Sigstore and Enclaves
        description: |
          Confidential computing is a breakthrough security technology.
          With it data can be kept encrypted during processing. Tools in the
          confidential computing space utilize these new concepts to provide
          fully-encrypted, high security environments, but as everyone in
          security knows: you are only as strong as your weakest link. Supply
          Chain Security is one of our industries weakest links. This talk will
          provide a deep drive of how Sigstore can help confidential (and other
          high security) products maintain a high level of security, keep their
          trusted compute base minimal, all the while preserving a high
          engineering velocity. To that end we will sketch out an architecture
          to build and sign in the cloud without malicious actors being able to
          steal signing keys or tamper with build processes. We will also show
          a live working demo of how such a system could be realized.

          Case study as an early adopter of Sigstore.
        description: |
          As an early adopter of Sigstore, Edgeless Systems provided me with the
          time to contribute a case study on how to use Sigstore to secure the
          releases and measurements of Constellation.

          After joining Edgeless Systems 6 months earlier, I shared my journey
          of learning about Confidential Computing with the Kubernetes and cloud
          native community at KCD Berlin 2022.
